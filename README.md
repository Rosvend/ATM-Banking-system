# OOP.Project
First OOP project in python using basic concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism. 
The project idea is to make a bank account that allows the customer to transfer, withdraw or deposit money when interacting with ATMs and it updates the balance whenever they make a movement.
